# Lattices
(Difficulty: Medium to Hard)

Lattice based cryptography is one of the advanced topics in cryptography. Before jumping into it I suggest
- A good grasp of Linear Algebra (taken at least 1 course)
- A good understanding of Abstract algebra (Rings, groups, fields, polynomials)
- Visual memory might help

In these notebooks I try to build up the lattice knowledge needed to build cryptosystems

I numbered the order you should study them in

Sadly, I had no time to write down reduction proofs but you'll find them in the resources / videos linked
