# Elliptic curves

In this directory you will find the theory I collected about Elliptic curves. This theory will come in handy later when we study different attacks on ECDLP

The order I studied them and I recommend them to be studied:

1. Elliptic_curves and Elliptic_curves_over_finite_fields notebooks 
    - You will develop a basic intuition and understanding of curves
    - You will understand the basic ECDLP algorithms
2. The Rational Points on Elliptic curves folder => From Silverman's Book
    - Going through these notebooks + reading the book should prepare your for intermediate attacks such as
        - Attacks on anomalous curves
        - Attacks on singular curves
3. Bilinear pairings
    - MOV attack
