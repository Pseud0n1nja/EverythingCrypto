# Primality tests

The algorithms in this section are methods by which arbitrary positive integers are tested to provide **partial information** regarding their primality. (Probabilistic tests)

We will explore the following tests: (I recommend to go through the Fermat's test first since there is the framework for general primality tests)

1. Probabilistic tests
    - Fermat's test
    - Solovan-Strassen test
    - Miller-Rabin test
    - Lucas test
2. Deterministic tests
