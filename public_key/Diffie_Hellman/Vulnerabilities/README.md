# Vulnerabilities

Here I collected some of the common vulnerabilities of DH.

Each notebook has

1. prerequisites for the attack
2. Theory
   - The vulnerability(task) we want to exploit
   - Some background theory + resources that helped me understand it
3. Code
   - Toy implementation
   - If there is a library that makes our life easier
4. More resources

# The order to study them

1. Beginner
   - Bad groups
   - Man in the middle attacks
2. Easy
3. Intermediate:
4. Hard
